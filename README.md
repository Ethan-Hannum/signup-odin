Sign-Up Form Project for The Odin Project

A non functional example of a sign up form. Got more experience with flexbox, form controls and advanced selectors. 
Biggest thing I learned while creating this page was how to position an image so that it stays in the same place, even
if the window is resized using max-width, max-height and flex.
